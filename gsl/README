Test GSL: GNU Scientific Library

Website: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

Version: gsl-2.4

Install: 
  - unzip the downloaded file
  - cd to the directory gsl-2.4
  - ./configure
  - make
  - make install

  Note that on Windows 7, using MinGW, for some reason aliasing make mingw32-make
  still does not allow the Makefile to find "make". The solution is to make a soft
  link in /c/MinGW/bin  make->mingw32-make
  
  Also, on Windows, some programs that are needed may be under C:/Program Files/
  The compiler does not like the space in the file name and the error such as

     sh: C:\Program: No such file or directory

  may occur. One solution is to reinstall those programs under C:/ directly, 
  rather than under C:/Program Files/.

  For some reason, make install has trouble installing doc directory. So doc is
  removed from SUBDIRS by hand to skip installing doc.

To compile, for example

   gcc main.c -Wall -I"/usr/local/include/" -L"/usr/local/lib/" -lm  -lgsl -lgslcblas

or

   gcc main.c -Wall $(gsl-config --cflags) $(gsl-config --libs) -o main
